## Motivation
There is a common saying, _"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail"_. 
In today's world, it is unproductive to stay unorganized.
**ResoToDo** helps you plan better to complete your new year resolutions.

## Methodology
It is a simple **ToDo Web App** that lets users add any text in the form of To-Do lists. 
Users can **add, remove, and strikethrough** any task.
Users can see the **current Date and Day**.

## Development
ResoToDo was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It started with writing HTML code. Then, it was designed using CSS.
However, the main part of the project was **JavaScript**.
**Selecting elements**, adding a To-Do by pressing the **Enter key**, **storing a To-Do in local storage**, **updating the To-Do**; **checking the list item** when selected, **striking the To-Do** by striking off the list item.

## Challenges
The most challenging part was to **target an element that was created dynamically**. It was the first time that I tried to implement it. Therefore, I spent max time searching for solutions on various websites.

## Accomplishments
I was able to implement how to **save elements in local storage** and **remove them** as well.

## Learning points
**To-Do List** project is a **beginner's JavaScript** project where we learn to** select, add, and update elements**. Moreover, we learn how to **target an element which dynamically created**, for example, When a user adds an item from the text box, the list item is dynamically created. **Targeting** that list item and **manipulating** it is a tough task. But I learned it pretty well!

## Future Scope
The next aim is to develop the ResoToDo App using **React.js**.
